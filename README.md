# Food sharing App
## Project Intro
Across the world, there are restaurants that waste tons of excess food everyday. This app is to establish a link between restaurants and the charity homes/needy households to enable excess food donation. There is also a 'goodwill' points system for restaurants to get rewarded for such a noble deed which they can use for their own marketing efforts by being a responsible social business as well.

## User Story
* Restaurant - indicate whether or not they have excess food available for donation, when they indicate yes they get “goodwill gold”.
* Charities/households - go onto application, see restaurants on a map in their area with excess food available
