# Food sharing App
## Project Intro
Across the world, there are restaurants that waste tons of excess food everyday. This app is to establish a link between restaurants and the charity homes/needy households to enable excess food donation. There is also a 'goodwill' points system for restaurants to get rewarded for such a noble deed which they can use for their own marketing efforts by being a responsible social business as well.

## User Story
* As a restaurant owner- if I have excess food available for donation, I would log in to the app and indicate yes on it, then I can get “goodwill gold”. Als It will help me with my own marketing efforts.
* As Charities/households - we wiil go onto application, see restaurants on a map in our area with excess food available. And contact with the restaurants and get the food.
