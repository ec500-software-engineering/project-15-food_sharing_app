# Food sharing App
## Project Intro
Across the world, there are restaurants that waste tons of excess food everyday. This app is to establish a link between restaurants and the charity homes/needy households to enable excess food donation. There is also a 'goodwill' points system for restaurants to get rewarded for such a noble deed which they can use for their own marketing efforts by being a responsible social business as well.

## User Story
* As a restaurant owner - if I have excess food available for donation, I would log in to the app and indicate yes on it, then I can get “goodwill gold”. Also, it will help me with my own marketing efforts.
* As Charities/households - we will go onto the application, see restaurants on a map in our area with excess food available. And contact with the restaurants and get the food.

## Modular Architecture  

## Technologies to be used  
* MYSQL or MongoBD
  - We need some type of database for our program. Because the information that will be storing will realtively consistent for all of the restaurant and individual users, we could use a relational database. We're still deciding since a non-relational database gives us freedom to change the type of information we store if we decide later on in the developing process that things should change.
* HTML
* MooTools
* Android Studio
  - We decided to make an Android Application since both of use have had previous exposure to Android Studio


## APIs
* Google Maps API & Street View Static API: For restaurants and charities to locate their positions.    
* Facebook API: Restaurant can share their dynamics to social networks when they get rewards food sharing.  
* Parse API: Store users data.
